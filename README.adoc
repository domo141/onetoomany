One Too Many
============

All of the applications and utilities of this repository
consists of just a single file.

This readme is (supposedly) the one too many (and that's good).

Each of these files includes their own License/Copyright information.


for users
---------

link:sshlessfs[sshlessfs]

Mount filesystem from remote system like sshfs but data connection for
transferring filesystem content between hosts is unencrypted.

In addition to "normal" mount also "reverse" mount is avaible; i.e. local
filesystem is mounted to remote host.

Sshlessfs uses ssh to create connection between hosts and when that is
created it launches sshfs(1) to the host where filesystem is to be
mounted and sftp-server(8) to the host which provides the filesystem.

middle ground
-------------

link:insync.pl[insync.pl]

Copy local directory tree to one or more remote directories and keep syncing
further changes to remotes.

Linux inotify(7) is used to recognize changes in the local file system

Simplest usage command line is +insync.pl . remotehost:remotedir+
which copies local current directory (tree) to 'remotedir' at 'remotehost'.

developer tools
---------------

link:uni2htmldiff.py[uni2htmldiff.py]

Create side-by-side html 5 document from unified diff source.

Example run
....
   $ git show 5d00a0440 | ./uni2htmldiff.py -o difftest.html 88 -
   $ echo file://$PWD/difftest.html
....
and give the resulting file:// url to web browser for further inspection.
